- Hi, I’m Scott Bockelman (@bockelman-scott), a professional software developer with over 25 years of experience designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining enterprise applications.
- Many of my past applications were successful because the team built and maintained its own frameworks for simplifying the development of specific types of functionality.
- My public github contributions are small frameworks or the building blocks for frameworks that might help other teams take a similar approach.
-
- I’m also currently learning the Unreal games engine and might publish some reusable blueprints or code here.
